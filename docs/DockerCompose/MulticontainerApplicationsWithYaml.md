[//]: # (Defining multi-container applications with YAML)

In Docker, you can define multi-container applications using a YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`. This file serves as a blueprint for your application, specifying the services, networks, volumes, and other configurations required.

To define a multi-container application, you need to follow these steps:

### 1.	Create a docker-compose.yml file: 
Start by creating a new file named `docker-compose.yml`. This file will contain all the information needed to define and configure your application's containers.

### 2.	Define services: 
In the `docker-compose.yml` file, you define the services that make up your application. Each service represents a container and includes details such as the Docker image to use, environment variables, ports to expose, and volumes to mount.

### 3.	Configure networks: 
Specify the networks that your services will connect to. Docker Compose allows you to create custom networks for your application, enabling containers to communicate with each other.

### 4.	Manage volumes: 
Define the volumes that your containers require for data persistence. Volumes allow you to store and share data between containers or with the host system.

### 5.	Set up dependencies: 
If your application has dependencies between services, you can define them in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This ensures that the required services start up in the correct order.

### 6.	Customize configurations: 
Docker Compose allows you to customize various configurations for your containers, such as environment variables, restart policies, logging options, and resource constraints.

### 7.	Run the application: 
Once you have defined your multi-container application in the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can use the `docker-compose up` command to start all the containers. Docker Compose will create the necessary containers based on the configurations you specified.

Defining multi-container applications with YAML gives you a convenient and scalable way to manage complex applications. By encapsulating the configuration details in a single file, you can easily share and reproduce your application environment across different systems.
