In this chapter, we'll delve into the core concept of container isolation and security. You'll understand how Docker employs various mechanisms to isolate containers from each other, making sure one misbehaving container cannot jeopardize others.

We'll also explore the best practices for securing Docker deployments. From configuring user permissions to restricting container capabilities, you'll learn essential techniques to maintain a robust and safe container ecosystem.

Additionally, we'll focus on securing container imagesâ€”the very foundation of your containerized applications. Understanding how to validate, sign, and scan images will be instrumental in ensuring only trusted and verified images are used within your Docker environment.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be well-versed in the art of Docker Security, equipped with the knowledge and tools to safeguard your containerized applications against potential threats.
