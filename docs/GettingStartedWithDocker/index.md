In the previous chapter, I introduced you to the fundamental aspects of Docker and its architecture.
In this chapter, I will take you on a step-by-step journey to get started with this powerful containerization technology. I will cover everything you need to know to begin your Docker adventure, from installing Docker on your system to understanding different Docker editions and variations.

First, I'll walk you through installing Docker on your computer, whether you're using Windows, macOS, or Linux. Docker provides a user-friendly installation experience, making it easy for anyone to get up and running quickly.

Next, we'll explore Docker's various editions and variations, such as Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS and Docker Engine for Linux. Each edition has unique features, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

Once you have Docker installed and have chosen the correct edition, we'll dive into the exciting part - running your very first Docker container! You'll learn to pull pre-built images from the Docker Hub, start containers, and interact with them.
By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid foundation in Docker, empowering you to easily create, manage, and scale applications.
