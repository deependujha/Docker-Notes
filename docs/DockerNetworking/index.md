In this chapter, we'll unravel the mysteries behind how Docker containers communicate and interact with each other in a seamless and efficient manner.
We'll begin with an insightful overview of Docker networking, understanding the fundamental concepts that underpin container communication. We'll explore bridge networks, a default network driver that facilitates communication between containers on the same host.

Container communication and linking will be our next stop, discovering how to establish connections between containers and facilitate data exchange.
But that's not all! You'll also learn how to create custom networks, tailoring your networking setup to suit your specific application requirements.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a firm grasp on the intricacies of Docker networking. You'll be well-equipped to establish robust communication pathways for your containers, making your applications highly interconnected and seamless.
