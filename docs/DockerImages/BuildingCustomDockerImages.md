[//]: # (Building Custom Docker Images)

While Docker provides a wide range of pre-built images on Docker Hub, you may often need to create your own custom images to meet specific requirements. 

Building custom Docker images allows you to package and configure your applications or services in a consistent and reproducible manner. Let's explore the process of building custom Docker images.

## Dockerfile:
Building a custom Docker image starts with creating a file called a Dockerfile. This file contains a set of instructions that Docker follows to build the image.

The Dockerfile specifies the base image to use, copies files into the image, sets environment variables, installs dependencies, and defines other configuration steps.
Dockerfiles use a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to understand. Each instruction represents a specific action to be performed during the image build process.


## Creating a Dockerfile:
- To create a Dockerfile, you can use any text editor. Start by creating a new file and giving it a name like "Dockerfile" (no file extension).
- Open the Dockerfile and write the instructions sequentially. For example, you can start with specifying the base image using the `FROM` instruction, such as:
```
FROM ubuntu:latest
```
- Continue adding instructions to configure the image as per your requirements. For example, you can use the `RUN` instruction to execute commands inside the image, the `COPY` instruction to copy files into the image, and the `ENV` instruction to set environment variables.


## Building an Image:
- Once you have created the Dockerfile, you can build the custom image using the docker build command.
- Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located, and run the following command:
```
docker build -t your-image-name:tag . 
```
- Replace `your-image-name` with a name of your choice and `tag` with an optional tag (e.g., version number or description).
- The ` . ` at the end of the command specifies the build context, which includes the Dockerfile and any other files required during the build process.
- Docker will read the Dockerfile, execute the instructions, and build the image according to the specified configuration.


## Using the Custom Image:
- Once the image is built, you can use it to run containers just like any other image.
- Run a container based on your custom image using the `docker run` command and the image name/tag you specified during the build process.
- Customize the container's behavior by providing additional options or environment variables.
