In this chapter, we will delve into the core aspects of Docker images, understanding their significance in the world of containerization.

Docker images are the building blocks of Docker containers, encapsulating everything an application needs to run smoothly. In this chapter, we will take a comprehensive look at how Docker images work and why they are essential for your container-based projects.

We'll explore Docker Hub and its treasure trove of official repositories, where you can find a vast array of pre-built images for popular applications and services. This means you won't have to start from scratch every time; many ready-to-use images are just a pull away!

Building custom Docker images is an invaluable skill, and I will guide you through the process step-by-step. You'll learn how to craft tailored images that perfectly suit your application's requirements, giving you complete control over your container environment.

In the end, I'll walk you through working with Dockerfiles, empowering you to automate and streamline your image-building process.
By the end of this chapter, you'll have a profound understanding of Docker images and the expertise to create, customize, and work with them effectively.
