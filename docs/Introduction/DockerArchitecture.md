[//]: # (Docker Architecture)

As I mentioned earlier, to understand Docker, it's important to grasp its architecture. Docker consists of three main components: the Docker engine, images, and containers. Let's explore each of these components:

### 1.	Docker Engine: 
At the heart of Docker is the Docker engine. It is responsible for building, running, and managing containers. The Docker engine includes two important components: the Docker daemon and the Docker client.
<ul>
<li><b>Docker Daemon</b>: The Docker daemon is a background service that runs on the host machine. It handles the creation, management, and execution of Docker containers. The daemon listens for Docker-related commands and requests.</li>

<li><b>Docker Client</b>: The Docker client is a command-line tool or a graphical interface that allows users to interact with the Docker daemon. You can use the Docker client to build, configure, and manage Docker containers and images.</li>
</ul>

### 2.	Docker Images: 
A Docker image is like a blueprint or a template for creating Docker containers. It contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies. You can think of it as a snapshot of a specific configuration or setup.

<ul>
<li><b>Layers and Union File System</b>: Docker images are composed of multiple layers. Each layer represents a specific modification or addition to the previous layer, forming a hierarchical structure. These layers are read-only and are stacked on top of each other. Docker uses a Union File System to efficiently manage and merge these layers, resulting in a lightweight and efficient image system.</li>

<li><b>Docker Registry</b>: Docker images can be stored and shared using a Docker registry. The most well-known registry is Docker Hub, which is a public repository containing numerous pre-built Docker images. You can also set up private registries to store and share custom images within your organization.</li>
</ul>

### 3.	Docker Containers: 
A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated and encapsulate the application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations. They provide a consistent and reproducible execution environment for the application.

<ul>
<li><b>Isolation and Resource Allocation</b>: Docker containers are lightweight and isolated from one another and the host system. They have their own file system, processes, and network interfaces. This isolation ensures that changes made in one container do not affect others. Docker also allows you to allocate specific CPU, memory, and other resources to each container.</li>

<li><b>Container Lifecycle</b>: Containers have a life cycle consisting of creation, running, pausing, stopping, and deletion. You can create, start, stop, restart, and remove containers using Docker commands or APIs. Containers can also communicate with one another or with the outside world through networking.</li>

<li><b>Container Orchestration</b>: Docker can be used in conjunction with container orchestration platforms like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. These platforms enable the management, scaling, and deployment of containers across multiple machines, providing additional features such as load balancing, service discovery, and high availability.</li>
</ul>

To better comprehend the concept of Docker architecture, let's consider an example that will help illustrate how it works. By examining this example, you'll gain a clearer understanding of Docker's architecture and its components. Let's delve into the example in the section that follows.
