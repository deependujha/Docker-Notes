[//]: # (Running A Blogging Platform)

Imagine you want to set up a blogging platform that consists of multiple components, including a web server, a database, and a caching system. Docker can help you achieve this by leveraging its architecture components:

### 1.	Docker Engine: 
The Docker engine comprises the Docker daemon and the Docker client. The daemon runs in the background, managing containers, while the client provides the interface to interact with the daemon.


You use the Docker client to issue commands like docker run, docker stop, and docker build to manage the containers that make up your blogging platform.

### 2.	Docker Images: 
Docker images serve as the blueprints for containers. Each image contains the necessary components and configurations required for a specific part of the blogging platform.


You create separate Docker images for the web server, the database, and the caching system. These images include the respective software, configurations, and dependencies. For instance, you might use an image with Nginx as the web server, MySQL as the database, and Redis as the caching system.

### 3.	Docker Containers: 
Docker containers are the running instances of Docker images. Each container represents a specific component of the blogging platform and operates independently, with its own isolated environment.


With Docker, you create containers based on the web server image, the database image, and the caching system image. Each container has its own file system, processes, and network interface. For example, the web server container serves the website, the database container handles data storage, and the caching system container improves performance.

### 4.	Docker Registry: 
Docker registries serve as repositories for storing and sharing Docker images.


You can store your custom Docker images in a private registry or use a public registry like Docker Hub. By pushing your images to a registry, you can easily share them with others or deploy them on different machines.

### 5.	Container Orchestration: 
Container orchestration platforms like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes help manage, scale, and deploy containers across multiple machines.


As your blogging platform gains popularity and traffic increases, you can use a container orchestration platform to scale the web server container horizontally by running multiple instances across multiple machines. The orchestration platform ensures load balancing, high availability, and fault tolerance.
